# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
  User.create([{ first_name: 'John', last_name: 'Doe' }, { first_name: 'Jane', last_name: 'Doe' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
